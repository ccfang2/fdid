\title{Estimate the event study coefficients and the covariance matrix}
\usage{
fdid(data, treatment)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame in which the first variable should be the outcome variable, and the latter two variables are time and unit indices. The outcome variable should be numeric.}

\item{treatment}{a data frame in which the first variable is the unit indices; the second variable indicates the reference time, right after which the treatment is given, for each unit.
NA implies that the unit is never treated/control. All pre-determined covariates are placed afterwards. Covariates should be numeric.}
}
\value{
The \code{fdid} function returns a list which includes the estimates of event study coefficients and their covariance. In the output, the event time 0 is considered as the
reference period. The output is an object of S3 class \code{"fdid"}.
}
\description{
The \code{fdid} function is used to estimate the event study coefficients and the covariance matrix in non-staggered or staggered adoption design.
In staggered design, our estimation does not suffer from the so-called negative weighting problem, since we use carefully-chosen non-negative weights to consolidate
estimates from each subgroup. See Fang and Liebl (2025) for detailed estimation method.
